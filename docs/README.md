Athena Framework was created with the intention of providing various high quality [components](./components/README.md) that can be used for things such as serialization, validation, dependency injection, etc.  These components can either be used on their own, or as a means to "build" an application; picking and choosing what is needed.  In addition to providing these "building blocks", the framework also provides an implementation of all the components into a cohesive and flexible foundation to a web application.  The design principles of the Athena Framework take heavy inspirations from various other frameworks including [Symfony](https://symfony.com/what-is-symfony), and [Spring](https://spring.io/why-spring).

## Feature Overview

In regards to other Crystal web frameworks, Athena employs some unique concepts, features, and design principles:

* Annotations are used to define & configure routes among other things
* Adheres to the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) design principles; basing its dependencies on interfaces, and providing a [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) Service Container to help manage dependencies/ease testing
* Event based; allows tapping into various events during the life-cycle of a request
* Flexible foundation; can make an application as simple or complex as needed, using only the features/components that are needed
